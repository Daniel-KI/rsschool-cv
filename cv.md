## Summary
Hi, my name is Daniil and I am a junior software developer. I have some experience in software development, such as web-applications for my univercity's course projects, diploma project and few projects on freelance. For these projects I used combination of *CSS*, *HTML*, *Bootstrap* and *Java* (*Spring*). Also, I have finished a *X++* development course for *Microsoft Dynamics AX* and have done a transport module project during internship in the company. Now I have chosen the way of a web-developer, because this sphere is the most interesting for me and to my mind, I can be more productive there. I think this course can help me to grow in this sphere and become a useful member of a development team. **I am ready for hard work and will be happy to cooperate with you.**
