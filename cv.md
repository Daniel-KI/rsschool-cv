## Summary
Hi, my name is Daniil and I am a junior software developer. I have some experience in software development, such as web-applications for my univercity's course projects, diploma project and few projects on freelance. For these projects I used combination of *CSS*, *HTML*, *Bootstrap* and *Java* (*Spring*). Also, I have finished a *X++* development course for *Microsoft Dynamics AX* and have done a transport module project during internship in the company.
